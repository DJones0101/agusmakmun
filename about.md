My name is Darius Jones. I'm a Computer Science Student at CSU Channel Islands üê¨. I will be graduating in Spring 2019.  Over the course of my studies, gained a fascination for Algorithms, Single Board Computers, Linux Operating Systems, and other Computer Science topics.

I post things that I find interesting, and solutions to problems that I come across when working on projects.  Thank you for viewing my site.

I can be reached by [email](https://www.google.com).
